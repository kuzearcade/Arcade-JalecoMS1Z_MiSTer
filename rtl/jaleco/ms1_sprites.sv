// Jaleco Mega System 1 sprite engine.
//
// Sprites are placed INDIRECTLY. Object RAM holds 4 banks of 256 eight-byte
// entries; each points at one of 128 sixteen-byte Sprite Data entries and adds
// displacements to it:
//
//   Object RAM   00 index into Sprite Data (masked to 0x7f)
//                02 H displacement   04 V displacement   06 number displacement
//
//   Sprite Data  08 bit 12 mosaic solid, bits 11:8 mosaic, bit 7 y flip,
//                   bit 6 x flip, bits 3:0 colour (bit 3 = priority)
//                0A H position   0C V position   0E tile number
//
// Which of the four Object RAM banks an entry belongs to is decided by the
// SPRITE's own flip bits: the entry is skipped unless attr[7:6] equals the
// bank index, so exactly one bank ever matches a given sprite.
//
// Order: MAME walks Object RAM DESCENDING (0x3fc down to 0, step 4) and the
// framebuffer write is FIRST-WRITER-WINS. That makes the LAST entry frontmost,
// which contradicts megasys1_v.cpp's own comment ("From first in Object RAM
// (frontmost) to last") and the note carried into docs/PLAN.md 4.D item 8.
// The CODE is mirrored here, because the code is what produced the oracle
// frames. No captured scene distinguishes the two orders, so this is recorded
// as unproven rather than settled -- docs/known-issues.md MS1-16.
//
// Screen flip is NOT applied here; it is a rotation of the finished frame in
// ms1_video.sv (docs/known-issues.md MS1-13).
//
// The framebuffer is one 256x256 plane of 9 bits {priority, colour, pen}, pen
// 15 meaning empty -- the same encoding MAME's 0x7fff fill uses. It is NOT
// double buffered: sprite_flag bit 4 ("do not clear the sprite framebuffer")
// deliberately lets the previous frame survive, which a swap would destroy.
// A swap is unaffordable anyway -- 589824 bits and 72 M10K per copy.
//
// BECAUSE IT IS SINGLE BUFFERED, THE PASS MUST FINISH BEFORE THE DISPLAY
// REACHES THE PLANE. It did not: with the clear at the head of the pass the
// whole thing took ~213000 clocks against the 165888 from vblank_rise to the
// first displayed row, so the top ~15 rows were read while they were still
// being drawn -- invisible on most scenes, and on Cybattler (the one ROT90
// set) a band of dropped sprites down the right of the rotated screen.
// MS1-60.
//
// The clear is therefore no longer part of the pass. It is swept a row at a
// time BEHIND THE DISPLAY READ, 256 clocks out of the 3072 in a raster line,
// which costs the pass nothing and cannot race the display by construction:
// a row is wiped only after the display has finished reading it.
//
// Memories are read COMBINATIONALLY (data valid the cycle after the address
// register updates), the convention the rest of this project's sims use.
// The plane needs 2R1W: port A is the engine's read-modify-write, port B is
// the display readback.

// ---- MS1-Z (BOARD_Z = 1) -------------------------------------------------
// System Z has no Object RAM. megasys1_typez_state::draw_sprites walks the 128
// Sprite Data entries themselves, 127 down to 0, through prio_transpen() --
// and prio_transpen ORs bit 31 into the priority mask ("high bit of the mask
// is implicitly on", drawgfx.cpp), while every opaque source pixel, drawn or
// not, sets the priority byte to 31. So the FIRST sprite to reach a pixel
// owns it: the HIGHEST index is frontmost, exactly as the driver's header
// comment says ("[MS1-Z] From last in Sprite RAM (frontmost) to first"). A
// first-writer-wins plane walked 127 down to 0 is that picture. A sprite
// hidden under layer 1 still owns its pixel and hides what is behind it, so
// the composite is simply sprites under an opaque layer 1 (ms1_video.sv).
// Attribute bit 3 has no effect: both of MAME's masks, 0x0a and 0x0c, hide a
// sprite under layer 1. No bank match, no displacements, no mosaic, colour =
// attr[3:0], and the code wraps modulo the ROM's tile count (TILE_MASK).
// Measured against MAME's demo frames: docs/known-issues.md MS1Z-7.
